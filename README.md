# task4
To complete the task, I first created a Flask application in app.py that defined the REST API endpoints for managing user data. The API supported the four fundamental CRUD operations: GET to retrieve all users, POST to add a new user, PUT to update an existing user, and DELETE to remove a user. The user records were stored in an in-memory Python dictionary, which acted like a temporary database. Once the server was running on http://127.0.0.1:5000, I created another script called test_api.py, which used the requests library to interact with the Flask API. This script sent different types of HTTP requests (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) to the running server and displayed the JSON responses, allowing me to verify that the API was working correctly. By combining the server (app.py) and the client tester (test_api.py), I successfully demonstrated a complete working REST API with Flask
